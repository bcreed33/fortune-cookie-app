# fortune-cookie-app

This is a JavaScript app I created from scratch. I made this in an effort to practice and refine my JavaScript skills. So normally a fortune cookie has nothing to do with a person's age. But I wanted to make this a little harder. I used boolean logic to display different fortunes based of the age the user inputted. Then for the lucky number area I used a for loop to populate the numbers.
